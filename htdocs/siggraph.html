          <h2 class="header2">Summary</h2>
          <p>The Student Volunteer Program wanted a more streamlined stronger experience as early on as the application process, and that was going to be accomplished by replacing a system that hadn’t been updated since being built in the early 2000s. Most
            of my focus involved <a href="#">Test</a> me leading workflows and designs to make the student application easier to understand and complete. The team was able to accomplish this by student applications rising by 18%.</p>
          <p>We have been successfully growing the system by having a retrospective after each milestone of the student application process, based off of the support emails we received from students. This allowed us to document and plan for designs and developments
            the following year.</p>
          <p>My time on this system will end in August 2019, but this has been an important project in my growth. It has built upon my knowledge on system designs, and taught me how consistent UX/UI expedites a user’s workflow. Finally, this has helped my
            remote communication and etiquette.</p>
          <p>My new goal for this system during my time left is take my experience as Communcation Lead for the Student Volunteer Sub Committee, and make additions to the software to receduce the amount of support email we receive.</p>

          <div id="users">
            <h2 class="header2">Users</h2>
            <p>When beginning this project, we identitied our three types of users that would have access to this system, along with their goals and pain points. This allowed us to make stronger decisions on the experience by using this a reference. </p>

            <h2 class="header2">Application</h2>
            <p>The first tasked we had for the system was having the application available that would be understood both by Student volunteers and Team leaders. In the pass, the form was not only difficult to understand, was not clear what was innacruately
              filled out, and how many characters a student typed into a form, or even what section of the form a student was in, or how much of the form they had left. But within one month, paint points of the form were reviewed, addressing it by having
              stronger error states, character counts at the bottom of the form, and having a page indicator at the top of the page, highlighting the current page a student was on.</p>

          <div id="student-profiles">
            <h2 class="header2">Profile</h2>
            <p>The largest struggle during the week at the conference is the schedule of shifts. Bwetween students not fully understanding specific information, team leaders working around many shifts, to the subcomittee getting up to date information on
              students, it can be a lot of confusion and spending precious time re-explaining information to many people.</p>
            <p>To fix this, we have an student volutneer and team leader profile that gives this information clearly. Breaking it down, a subcomittee can view all information of a student volunteer, including quickly seeing which programs and team leaders
              they work with and their schedule. Information can be drilled further by click on a time and a modal appearing with an overview of their performance, including whether they showed up for a shift or not.</p>
            <p>For a team leader, being able to quickly scan a list of student volunteers along with checking them in and out is important in order to streamline setup time and switching students in a program. Appearing on their modal is a table with a list
              of actions per student, including an option to write a review.</p>
            <p>Lastly, we have student volunteers who have two main points. Not clearing knowing what tiem their shift is, taking a while to grasp that they need to be at the office 30 minutes before their shift for setup and training, and knowing who their
              team leader will be for that shift. For this we add all of this information to their modal, including having a picture of their TL that will make it easier for the student to quickly identity their lead.</p>
